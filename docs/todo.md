# TODO

Things I need to do for this project

## Fog

ThreeJS has a concept of fog, I should add that

## Alternative text loaders for the <Text /> component

Currently only using procedural geometry, which might not be the right fit for all instances

## Lighting

There should be lights

## Model Loading

Explain how models are loaded from the public folder

## Object Removal

Objects need to be manually removed from the threejs scene on dismount, or their memory won't clear. I'm not currently doing this

## Server Stuff

- Multiplayer Do some basic netcode work to allow sharing state
- Chat: Allow for text, audio, and video chat
