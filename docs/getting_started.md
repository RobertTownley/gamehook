# Getting Started

## Installation

`pnpm install gamehook three`
`pnpm add -D @types/three`

## Usage

Visit the `examples` folder for some demos of how to use Gamehook.

You can also pull down this repo and run `pnpm run dev` to see the examples running in a working project. Just change the name of the example within `App.tsx`

## Coming Soon

- I plan to make this documentation a much more useful and interactive experience. PRs welcome, or open issues if you're looking for any specific features
- The library is still in early alpha. Backwards compatibility isn't guaranteed, and I might break some things over the course of discovering how useful the engine can be for things I'm working on.
